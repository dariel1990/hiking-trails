## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

- Test with small GPX files first
- Keep backups of original GPX files

❌ **DON'T:**

- Trust GPX data blindly - always review
- Delete trails without backing up GPX files

## Troubleshooting

- Try exporting again from your GPS device

**"Error processing GPX file"**
- File might be corrupted
- File size might be too large
- Contact support if issue persists

**Calculations seem wrong**
- GPX quality varies by device
- Manually adjust if needed
